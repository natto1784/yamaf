* Yet Another Mid Ahh Filehost

- YAMAF is a yet another mid ahh filehost for personal use.
- It is extremely simple and minimal and might break under niche circumstances like uploading many huge files.
- It uses axum unlike its predecessors[fn:1][fn:2], both of which were written in rust some time ago now.
